# Nexpose

This is the official gem package for the Ruby Nexpose API.

## Contributions

This package is currently a work in progress. Most of the Nexpose API is exposed, but there are some operations missing. Also, there are stylistic differences between different calls that we hope to eliminate over time. We welcome contributions to this package. We ask only that pull requests and patches adhere to our coding standards.

* Favor returning classes over key-value maps. Classes tend to be easier for users to manipulate and use.
* Unless otherwise noted, code should adhere to the Ruby Style Guide: https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide
* Use YARDoc comment style to improve the API documentation of the gem.
